# This script is a wrapper around `ip netns add/delete' that allows network
# namespaces to have custom configuration files in /etc/, such as
# /etc/resolv.conf. It imitates how iproute2 persists network namespaces by
# bind-mounting /proc/self/ns/net to files in /var/run/netns, except with mount
# namespaces in /var/run/mountns instead, and then mounts an overlayfs merging
# /etc/ with /etc/netns/X to /etc/. nsdo will setns() to /var/run/mountns/X if
# it exists, making the program it runs use the netns-specific /etc/ changes.
